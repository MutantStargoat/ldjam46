Save the penguin
================
An unfinished game for the ludum dare #46 jam (theme: keep it alive).

Concept:  
 The penguin is stranded on a patch of ice, and there are tentacle monsters in
 the water, so it's afraid to swim. Help it return to its nest by floating
 nearby pieces of ice into its path for it to hop onto, before the tentacle
 monsters get it.

The game was unfortunately not completed, but here it is at it stands a few
minutes after the deadline.

Run the game (use the `RUN` script on GNU/Linux) and press F1 for instructions.
You can play around with the physics and let the penguin jump between patches
of ice, but there's no goal yet, and the tentacles won't really harm you.
